	<!-- Answer 22 -->
	<p>An attribute provides additional information about an element and is always specified in the start tag of the element using the attribute name and value. For example, in the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, the attribute <code>href</code> is used to specify the URL that the link should go to.</p>

	<!-- Question 23 -->
	<h2>23. What attribute tells links where to go?</h2>
	<!-- Answer 23 -->
	<p>The <code>href</code> attribute tells links where to go. It is used to specify the URL of the page or file that the link should go to.</p>

	<h2>24. What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?</h2>
    <p>An absolute link specifies the complete URL of the target page, including the protocol (e.g. http or https), domain name, and path to the page. A relative link, on the other hand, specifies the path to the target page relative to the location of the current page. Relative links are often shorter and more convenient to use, especially when linking to pages within the same website.</p>

    <h2>25. Which element is used to display an image?</h2>
    <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is used to display an image in HTML. It is a self-closing tag and requires a few attributes to function properly, such as the <code>src</code> attribute, which specifies the URL of the image file, and the <code>alt</code> attribute, which provides alternative text for the image.</p>

    <h2>26. What two attributes do images always need to have?</h2>
    <p>Images in HTML always need to have the <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> attributes. The <code>src</code> attribute specifies the URL of the image file, while the <code>alt</code> attribute provides alternative text for the image. The <code>alt</code> attribute is important for accessibility reasons, as it allows screen readers and other assistive technologies to describe the image to users who cannot see it.</p>

    <h2>27. How do you access a parent directory in a file path?</h2>
    <p>To access a parent directory in a file path, you can use the <code>..</code> notation. This notation represents the parent directory of the current directory. For example, if you have a file located at <code>http://example.com/folder1/folder2/file.html</code> and you want to link to a file in <code>folder1</code>, you can use a relative link like this: <code>&lt;a href="../index.html"&gt;Go to homepage&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>

    <h2>28. What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web?</h2>
    <p>The four main image formats that you can use for images on the web are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>JPEG:</strong> A lossy format that is best for photographs and images with lots of color gradients.</li>
    <li><strong>PNG:</strong> A lossless format that supports transparency and is best for images with sharp lines and text.</li>
    <li><strong>GIF:</strong> A format that supports animation and transparency, but has a limited color palette and is best for simple graphics and animations.</li>
    <li><strong>SVG:</strong> A vector format that scales well and supports interactivity, but may not be supported by all browsers.</li>
    </ul>
